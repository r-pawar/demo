### Requirements

You are writing code for a company that builds software to track and invoice for movie rentals and are asked to add a new billing rule for classic movies:

- Renting a classic movie costs $1 per day, earns 1 reward point per day, and has no fixed rental cost.

The codebase works in its current form, but was originally written by a junior engineer. Refactor the code as you see necessary and add the new billing rule. Make reasonable assumptions and document them.

We will check that your code works, but are more interested in your approach to refactoring, code design, and the decisions you make. We will be asking you about the decisions you made in the next phase of the the interview so be prepared to speak to them.
